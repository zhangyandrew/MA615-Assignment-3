There is a schema for each of the variables available in the link above.

Also put your name as an author above.

```{r, Andrew}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
season_ball <- read.csv("Seasons_Stats.csv")
season_ball$blank2 <- NULL
season_ball$blanl <- NULL
season_ball <- na.omit(season_ball)

## Looking and comparing win shares and number of three pointers made
## Comparing different eras of basketball to understand styles of play

## 2017 Season
ball_2017 <- season_ball %>% filter(Year == 2017)

ball_2017 %>% arrange(desc(X3P))
ball_2017 %>% arrange(desc(WS))

ggplot(ball_2017, aes(X3P, WS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## 2010 Season
ball_2010 <- season_ball %>% filter(Year == 2010)

ball_2010 %>% arrange(desc(X3P))
ball_2010 %>% arrange(desc(WS))

ggplot(ball_2010, aes(X3P, WS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## 2003 Season
ball_2003 <- season_ball %>% filter(Year == 2003)

ball_2003 %>% arrange(desc(X3P))
ball_2003 %>% arrange(desc(WS))

ggplot(ball_2003, aes(X3P, WS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## Look at the number of 3 pointers made per team
## Notice the top teams from 2017 have some of the highest number of 3 pointers made

ball_2017 %>% group_by(Tm) %>% summarize(sum(X3P))
```

We can see a more positive trend for the 2017 data. This can possibly indicate more of a correlation between number of threes made and how well a team might do.

```{r, age}
ball_2017 %>% arrange(desc(Age))

ggplot(ball_2017, aes(Age, MP)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

ggplot(ball_2010, aes(Age, MP)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

ggplot(ball_2003, aes(Age, MP)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
View(season_ball)
```


```{r}
#Players' age over 25
ball1 <- filter(season_ball, !is.na(Age) & Age >= 25)
ball1

ball2 <- select(ball1, Year, Player, Tm, Age, Pos, G, PTS)
ball2

arrange(ball2, desc(PTS))

ggplot(ball2, aes(Age, PTS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#2008 Season
b1 <- filter(season_ball, Year==2008)
b2 <- select(b1, Year, Player, Tm, Age, Pos, G, X3P, X2P, PTS) 
b2

b2 %>%
  arrange(desc(PTS)) %>%
  summarise(total = n(), min.PTS = min(PTS), average.PTS = mean(PTS), max.PTS = max(PTS))

b2 %>%
  arrange(desc(X3P)) %>%
  summarise(total = n(), min.X3P = min(X3P), average.X3P = mean(X3P), max.X3P = max(X3P))

b2 %>%
  arrange(desc(X2P)) %>%
  summarise(total = n(), min.X2P = min(X2P), average.X2P = mean(X2P), max.X2P = max(X2P))
  
b2 %>%
  group_by(Tm) %>%
  summarise(N = n(), avg_PTS = mean(PTS, na.rm=TRUE)) 

ggplot(b2, aes(G,PTS)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

ggplot(b2, aes(X3P,PTS)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

ggplot(b2, aes(X2P,PTS)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
