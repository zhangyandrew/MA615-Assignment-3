There is a schema for each of the variables available in the link above.

Also put your name as an author above.

```{r, Andrew}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
season_ball <- read.csv("Seasons_Stats.csv")
season_ball$blank2 <- NULL
season_ball$blanl <- NULL
season_ball <- na.omit(season_ball)

## Looking and comparing win shares and number of three pointers made
## Comparing different eras of basketball to understand styles of play

## 2017 Season
ball_2017 <- season_ball %>% filter(Year == 2017)

ball_2017 %>% arrange(desc(X3P))
ball_2017 %>% arrange(desc(WS))

ggplot(ball_2017, aes(X3P, WS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## 2010 Season
ball_2010 <- season_ball %>% filter(Year == 2010)

ball_2010 %>% arrange(desc(X3P))
ball_2010 %>% arrange(desc(WS))

ggplot(ball_2010, aes(X3P, WS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## 2003 Season
ball_2003 <- season_ball %>% filter(Year == 2003)

ball_2003 %>% arrange(desc(X3P))
ball_2003 %>% arrange(desc(WS))

ggplot(ball_2003, aes(X3P, WS)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

## Look at the number of 3 pointers made per team
## Notice the top teams from 2017 have some of the highest number of 3 pointers made

ball_2017 %>% group_by(Tm) %>% summarize(sum(X3P))
```

We can see a more positive trend for the 2017 data. This can possibly indicate more of a correlation between number of threes made and how well a team might do.

```{r, age}
ball_2017 %>% arrange(desc(Age))

ggplot(ball_2017, aes(Age, MP)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

ggplot(ball_2010, aes(Age, MP)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

ggplot(ball_2003, aes(Age, MP)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
